# *Fake News Detection using Python and Machine Learning*

## ðŸ“Œ *Project Overview*
This project focuses on building a *Fake News Detection* system using *Python* and *Machine Learning* techniques. The model classifies news articles as *"Real"* or *"Fake"* based on their content. The project utilizes *Natural Language Processing (NLP)* for text preprocessing and various classification algorithms for model building.

## ðŸ“Š *Dataset*
The dataset used in this project is taken from *Kaggle*. It contains two files:
- *True.csv:* Contains real news articles.
- *Fake.csv:* Contains fake news articles.

You can download the dataset from the following link:
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)

---

## ðŸ”„ *Data Preprocessing*
The following preprocessing steps were performed on the dataset:
- Converting text to lowercase.
- Removing punctuation and special characters.
- Removing stopwords.
- Tokenization.
- Stemming/Lemmatization.

---

## ðŸ¤– *Machine Learning Model*
The following algorithms were used for building the Fake News Detection model:
1. *Logistic Regression*
2. *Naive Bayes*

The text data was vectorized using *TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)* to convert text into numerical features.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ *Model Evaluation*
The model performance was evaluated using:
- *Accuracy Score*
- *Confusion Matrix*
- *Precision, Recall, F1 Score*

---

## ðŸš€ *How to Run the Project*

1. *Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the model:*
   bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/fake_news_detection.ipynb
   

2. *Run the Flask app for deployment:*
   bash
   python app.py
